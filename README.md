# forest_job_creation
This project highlights my data wrangling (Liu_Nancy.Rmd) and shiny dynamic dashboard skills (Liu_Nancy_app.R). I cleaned and merged three datasets from different sources using R, and used the combined data to conduct a data-driven analysis that could inform potential policy proposals. I then presented key metrics and visualizations to update clients how forest protection would help job creation in California in a clear and interactive way.
